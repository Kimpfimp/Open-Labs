        <p>Are you thinking of getting a dachshund puppy or adopting a young dachshund? Are you wondering what you’ll need to buy? What else you need to think about? And where you start with it all? We’re going to give you tips and advice on what you need to do and things you should buy to care for your new dachshund.</p>

        <p>How to care for a dachshund. This is how to care for a dachshund:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Buy your dachshund the essentials (bed, food, lead, collar etc.)</li>
            <li>Make sure he’s microchipped and vaccinated</li>
            <li>Feed him at least twice a day (3 times for pups)</li>
            <li>Let him out for a wee every few hours (every 30 mins for pups)</li>
            <li>Exercise and play with him every day (5 mins per month of age for pups)</li>
            <li>Keep him clean and groomed</li>
            <li>Give him lots of love</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Get out for daily exercise</h2>
        <p>Work out your dachshund’s exercise schedule, and stick to it! Dachshunds don’t need loads of exercise, but they do need to do something every day. For puppies, stick to the ‘5 minutes per month of age’ rule (up until they’re 12 months old). So a 12 week old puppy would need just 15 minutes of exercise per day (3 months x 5 minutes = 15 minutes). Adult Miniature dachshunds need at least 30 minutes of daily exercise and adult standard dachshunds need 60 minutes or more.</p>
