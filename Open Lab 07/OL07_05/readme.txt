Please follow these steps:

    1) This is the same exercise as OL6_05 but:
        ? You must solve it without using classes or ids.
        ? You may only use <div> and <span> inside <body>. Ignore the links (turn them to divs).

You could of course copy the HTML file form the suggested solutions… but that wouldn’t help much in learning. Up to you.


Note:
It can be difficult to get both pages the same since h1 and p have default sizes and margins. It’s fairly easy to find out about the approximate default size and margins but perhaps not the EXACT ones. Make the pages as similar as you can.

The default size of the font in h1 is 2em.
The default size of the font in p is 1em.

The default size of the margin top and bottom for p and h1 is… (look it up!)
(em is a fine unit that we have not talked about. You can look it up on the web or you can just use it)
