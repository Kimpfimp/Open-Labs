All open Labs excercises from MPP studies at Malmö University with explanations

## Language

Alla förklaringar är såklart på svenska, men standardspråket i webben är engelska

## Structure

Open Labs are structured in an ordered list.
They they follow the tree structure of:

Open Lab 01 <-- This is the main folder <br>

- Open Lab 1_1 <-- Excercise one
- Open Lab 1_2 <-- Excercise two
- Open Lab 1_3 <-- Excercise three
- ...

## Content

This repo does not contain the original files, only the finished excercises<br>
You will find explanations for all excercises within the .html and .css files themselves as comments

## Questions

I am not here to answer any questions, check out Google and come to the Open Labs or ask in Discord/Facebook :)
You will need continuos practice to learn, so if you copy code to get in excercises in time, then you will only cheat yourself.

## YOU NEED TO PRACTICE

It's like wanting to run a Marathon without practicing and you will feel like dying in the end if you don't practice enough (:
